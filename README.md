AndroidRawResMusicPlayer - by Devprincess
========================

This is a tutorial to create a media player in Android reading from raw resources. 
It is only loading with one single song for testing purposes but if you want to extend it, 
you can create a loop in your own code for your personal use.

The song inside this project does not belong to me and I have no rights from it, the license of the song called "Summer" 
can be found in the following url: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.es  
("Summer" by Jorge Martin Garc√≠a Vega)
