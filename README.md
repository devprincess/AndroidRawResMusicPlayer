AndroidRawResMusicPlayer
========================

This is a tutorial to create a basic media player in Android reading from raw resources. 
It is only loading with one single song for testing purposes but if you want to extend it, 
you can use it in a loop inside your own code for your personal project.

The song inside this project does not belong to me and I have no rights from it, the license of the song called "Summer" 
can be found in the following url: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.es  
("Summer" by Jorge Martin Garc√≠a Vega)
